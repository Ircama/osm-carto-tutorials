The goal for this procedure is to use [Ubuntu packages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_(operating_system)#Package_classification_and_support) and official [PPA](https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/publish/other-forms-of-submitting-apps/ppa/)s whenever possible.

We consider using [Ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_(operating_system)) 20.04.2 LTS [Focal Fossa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_version_history#Ubuntu_20.04_LTS_(Focal_Fossa)), or 18.04 LTS [Bionic Beaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_version_history#Ubuntu_18.04_LTS_(Bionic_Beaver)), suggested operating system version.

Other tested O.S. include Ubuntu 16.04 LTS [Xenial Xerus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_version_history#Ubuntu_16.04_LTS_.28Xenial_Xerus.29), Ubuntu 15.4 [Vivid Vervet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_version_history#Ubuntu_15.04_.28Vivid_Vervet.29) or Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS [Trusty Tahr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_version_history#Ubuntu_14.04_LTS_.28Trusty_Tahr.29) (other versions should work). All should be [64-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit_computing) computing architecture. Other distributions like Debian might be checked, but could require changes to the installation procedure.

This procedure is updated to the version of OpenStreetMap Carto available at the time of writing. To get the correct installation procedure, the [INSTALL history](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/blame/master/INSTALL.md) should be checked, considering that the OpenStreetMap Carto maintainers use to keep the [INSTALL](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/blob/master/INSTALL.md) page updated. Check also the [README changelog](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/blame/master/README.md).

## General setup for Ubuntu

[Install Ubuntu](../install-ubuntu){:target="_blank"}.

This procedure also supports [WSL - Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). This means that a Windows 10 64-bit PC can be used to perform the installation, after setting-up WSL.

### Update Ubuntu

Make sure your Ubuntu system is fully up-to-date:

    lsb_release -a

Previous command returns the Ubuntu version.

To update the system:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade
```

If on a brand new system you also want to do `sudo apt-get dist-upgrade && sudo shutdown -r now`.

### Install essential tools

```shell
sudo apt-get -y install ca-certificates gnupg curl unzip gdal-bin \
tar wget bzip2 build-essential clang python3-psycopg2 python3-yaml \
python3-requests postgresql-client
```

Optional elements:

```shell
sudo apt-get -y install munin-node munin protobuf-c-compiler libtiff5-dev
libcairomm-1.0-dev libagg-dev lua5.1 liblua5.1-0-dev
```

Check prerequisites suggested by [openstreetmap-carto](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/blob/master/Dockerfile#L11-L12).

For the subsequent installation steps, we suppose that `cd` defaults to your home directory.

### Configure a swap

Importing and managing map data takes a lot of RAM and a swap is generally needed.

To check whether a swap partition is already configured on your system, use one of the following two commands:

* Reports the swap usage summary (no output means missing swap):

      swapon -s

* Display amount of free and used memory in the system (check the line specifying *Swap*):

      free -h

If you do not have an active swap partition, especially if your physical memory is small, you should add a swap file. First we use `fallocate` command to create a file. For example, create a file named *swapfile* with 2G capacity in root file system:

    sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile

Then make sure only *root* can read and write to it.

    sudo chmod 600 /swapfile

Format it to swap:

    sudo mkswap /swapfile

Enable the swap file

    sudo swapon /swapfile
    
The Operating System tuning adopted by the OpenStreetMap tile servers can be found in the related [Chef configuration](https://github.com/openstreetmap/chef/blob/master/roles/tile.rb#L49-L63).

### Check usage of English locale

Run locale to list what locales are currently defined for the current user account:

    locale

To set the en_GB locale:

    export LANGUAGE=en_GB.UTF-8
    export LANG=en_GB.UTF-8
    export LC_ALL=en_GB.UTF-8

The exported variables can be put to the file `/etc/environment`.

New locales can also be generated by issuing:

    sudo locale-gen en_GB en_GB.UTF-8
    sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
