## Introduction

After the initial load of a PBF extract (or of the whole "planet") into a target database, there might be a need to keep data up to date. For this, OpenStreetMap provides [minutely, hourly and daily change files](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm/diffs) that can be applied to a replicated database so that it can be kept in sync with the master OSM db: each time a user uploads a modification (addition, update, change, deletion of features) to OSM, the change can be replicated to a database synched with the master data within the selected timeframe.

OpenStreetMap allows this by exploiting the [replication feature](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis/Replication) available within a tool named [Osmosis](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis) (a command line Java application for processing OSM data) and described in the [Replication Tasks](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis/Detailed_Usage_0.45#Replication_Tasks) section of the related [usage page](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis/Detailed_Usage).

Osmosis can be downloaded (e.g., from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/openstreetmap/osmosis)) and installed as part of a tile server to perform data replication via periodic syncs. It allows automating the process of downloading the proper "replication files" which are produced by OpenStreetMap in OSC (Open Street Map Change) change file format. Then generally [Osm2pgsql](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osm2pgsql) is used to import the downloaded changes into your PostgreSQL database (through the `--append` option).

## Manually merging distinct areas into PostgreSQL

After the initial import of OpenStreetMap data (e.g., a PBF file) into your PostgreSQL database via Osm2pgsql, it might be needed to manually merge other distinct / non-overlapping areas (e.g., included in separate PBF files).

Check this [Q&A](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/186754/how-to-quickly-load-two-distinct-areas-into-postgis-without-using-append-flag).

[Osmconvert](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmconvert) is a command line tool to convert and process OpenStreetMap files.

## Keeping the PostgreSQL database up to date

The following procedure explains how to keep the tile server and the PostgreSQL database up-to-date with the latest OSM data.

This paragraph is currently in early stage, not yet tested and revised. Information at the moment is largely taken from the *Updating* paragraph of [Building a tile server from packages](https://switch2osm.org/serving-tiles/building-a-tile-server-from-packages) page within [switch2osm.org](https://switch2osm.org).

After importing the initial database with *osm2pgsql* as described in "[Get an OpenStreetMap data extract](../tile-server-ubuntu#get-an-openstreetmap-data-extract)" (you will need to have used the *-slim* option in the initial import to allow for updating), you need to do the following steps.

Install *osmosis*:

    sudo apt-get install osmosis

Grant rights to the update tables to user *www-data*:

    sudo /usr/bin/install-postgis-osm-user.sh gis www-data

Initialise the *osmosis* replication stack to the data of your data import. Choose the date of the planet data, as this is the date from which the diffs will start.

    sudo -u www-data /usr/bin/openstreetmap-tiles-update-expire 2012-04-21

As the packaged script currently uses an outdated service to determine the correct replication start-point, you will need to manually choose and download the correct *state.txt* from the *base_url* (see below) which corresponds to slightly before the age of the extract to make sure all modifications are included in your db. This needs to be copied to `/var/lib/mod_tile/.osmosis/state.txt`.

You will next need to update the default configuration of *osmosis*. In `/var/lib/mod_tile/.osmosis/configuration.txt` change the `base_url` to `http://planet.openstreetmap.org/replication/minute/`

Update your tileserver by up to an hour and expire the corresponding rendered tiles:

    sudo -u www-data /usr/bin/openstreetmap-tiles-update-expire

If your tile server is behind more than an hour you will need to call the *openstreetmap-tiles-expire* script multiple times. If you want to continuously 

keep your server up to data, you need to add the *openstreetmap-tiles-expire* script to your crontab.

Keeping the data up-to-date can be resource intense, in particular because after the import you may already be multiple days behind. Consider changing *maxInterval* in `/var/lib/mod_tile/.osmosis/configuration.txt` to 21600 (six hours) till you have caught up. Further, add *â€“number-processes 2* to the 

*osm2pgsql* command in `/usr/bin/openstreetmap-tiles-update-expire` or a higher number if this is appropriate for your hardware.

The initial install installed pre-processed coastlines, from time to time it may make sense to replace the files with new versions:

    wget http://tile.openstreetmap.org/processed_p.tar.bz2

and extract it to

    /etc/mapnik-osm-data/world_boundaries/
