vial.openstreetmap.org
Tile server

https://hardware.openstreetmap.org/servers/vial.openstreetmap.org/

vial is running Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS
All three tile servers are now running mapnik 3.0.9 with postgres 9.5 and postgis 2.2.
I updated carto to the latest release when doing the upgrades so it is 0.16.3 currently. That is installed from npm anyway so is easily upgraded when necessary.
