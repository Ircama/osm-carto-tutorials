  "body": "# OpenStreetMap Carto Tutorials\r\n\r\nThis site includes unofficial tutorials to set-up a development environment of [openstreetmap-carto](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto) and be able to contribute to this project.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this site is to keep track of notes that have been useful to me and that I hope will be also of help to newbies in order to master OpenStreetMap Carto fast, learning all most relevant aspects from the ground up and avoiding frustration on installation, Git usage, configuration and other matters that generally need to be faced when approaching such project.\r\n\r\nAll pages of this site are in blog form, allowing anyone to add open comments and contribute.\r\n\r\n**DISCALIMER**: documentation included in this site is not only **unofficial**, but also **unapproved** by the maintainers of openstreetmap-carto. The included information requires several improvements that will be possibly addressed in the future and I strongly recommend referencing the official documentation for openstreetmap-carto, which is included here: https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto. Keep also in mind that some information might be only valid at the time of writing and could require update that I have not been able to accomplish.\r\n\r\n## OpenStreetMap Carto\r\n\r\n[OpenStreetMap Carto](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto) includes the [CartoCSS map stylesheets](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/CartoCSS) for the [Standard map layer](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Standard_tile_layer) on OpenStreetMap.org. The styles can be converted from CartoCSS to XML and then processed by [Mapnik](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapnik)\r\n\r\nCartoCSS is a [CSS-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) language for map design developed by [MapBox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapbox) and adopted by OpenStreetMap through OpenStreetMap Carto.\r\n",
