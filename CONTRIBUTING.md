# Workflow

We operate the "Fork & Pull" model explained at

https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/

You should fork the project into your own repo, create a topic branch there and then make one or more pull requests back to the osm-carto-tutorials repository. Your pull requests will then be reviewed and discussed.

## Notes

You can use Git Desktop to clone the repository.

To save the credentials:

    git config --global credential.helper cache

To set the vi editor:

    git config --global core.editor "vi"
